# Current Backlog

## Status

This document summarizes the active TriageCore backlog after CR-021 through CR-024.

## Active GitHub Backlog

- Issue #4: Persistent cryptographic agent identities
  - Status: open
  - Related CR: CR-020
  - Purpose: add persistent local agent identities, signed ledger-event metadata, revocation, capability checks, and crypto-agile algorithm metadata.
  - Current phase: Phase 5 and CR-027 key hardening complete
  - Next gate: key revocation, rotation/recovery policy, and a metadata-only signed smoke path before broader signing

## Candidate Future Work

- Circuit breakers and degraded mode states
  - Source: older Drive performance backlog
  - Status: candidate future CR, not yet active GitHub backlog
  - Purpose: allow unstable routes to cool down instead of retrying immediately.

## Completed Safety Spine

- CR-021: Persistent Artifact Privacy Invariant
- CR-022: Context Facet Pruning Plan
- CR-023: Offline Demo Dry-Run Evidence
- CR-024: Persistent Artifact Audit Command
- CR-026: Post-Identity Privacy and Security Audit
- CR-027: Identity Key Hardening and Consistency Check

## Current Recommendation

Keep Issue #4 open and pause signing expansion beyond `route_audit`.
Private-key permission and consistency checks are now implemented. Revocation,
rotation/recovery policy, and a metadata-only signed smoke path remain before
adding signed event types.
